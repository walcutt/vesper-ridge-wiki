This site documents the city and surrounding world of Vesper Ridge, a setting created by my friend Mimi.

The source code for it can be found [here](https://github.com/walcutt/vesper-ridge-wiki).

This site is based off of a fork of [this Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), incorporating [this search tool](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search).

Built and maintained by Chloe.
