title: Amber Grove Park
---

A large, heavily wooded public park in the center of the Tower Ward. Under the shade of its proud trees sit the hallowed ruins of the city’s first shrine to the Keeper, now fenced off from the public.  

Vesperites from all walks of life enjoy going for strolls through Amber Grove Park. It’s almost scenic enough to make one forget the filth of the surrounding city.
