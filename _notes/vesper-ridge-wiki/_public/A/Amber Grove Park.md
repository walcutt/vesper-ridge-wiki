title: Amber Grove Park
---

A large, heavily wooded public park in the center of the [[Tower Ward]]. Under the shade of its proud trees sit the hallowed ruins of the city’s first shrine to [[The Keeper]], now fenced off from the public.  

[[Vesperite|Vesperites]] from all walks of life enjoy going for strolls through Amber Grove Park. It’s almost scenic enough to make one forget the filth of the surrounding city.
