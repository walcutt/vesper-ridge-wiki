title: Apostate Liturgists
---

A tall, vaguely humanoid creature with flesh of flowing liquid flame and a pair of great black wings framing its body. By means unknown, it appeared to burst forth from the body of a [[Supplicants|supplicant]] in response to the partyâ€™s arrival.

As its appearance would suggest, the liturgist possesses some ability to wield and command fire as a weapon.
