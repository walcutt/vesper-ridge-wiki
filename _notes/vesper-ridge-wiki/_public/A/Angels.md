title: Angels

Divine messengers sent to execute [[The Keeper|the Keeper’s]] will on the material plane. There are various types of angel, each one given the form most suited to carry out its specific task. Most angels are rarely (if ever) encountered by mortals, and little is known about them, but rumors claim that they make regular contact with the clerics of the esteemed [[House von Helzen]].

It’s thought that in times long past, angels may have served other gods as well.
