title: Ainsley Vespridge
---

The head of House Vespridge and the closest thing Vesper Ridge has to a monarch. Technically the Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council is the highest governing body in the city, but Duke Ainsley has great influence over the Parliamentary Councilâ€™s proceedings. He is a direct descendant of Baron Morian Vespridge, the founder of the city.

For reasons unknown, Duke Ainsley is almost never seen in public, and never attends social events.
