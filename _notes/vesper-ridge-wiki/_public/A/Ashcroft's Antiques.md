title: Ashcroft's Antiques
---

A small antique shop in the [[Southern Ward]]. It is a rarity in [[Vesper Ridge]] as one of the few places magic items can be purchased in broad daylight. Prices tend to run a bit high...

For the time being, the shop’s doors are closed due to the untimely passing of its original owner, [[Poor Jimmy Ashcroft]]. Ownership has passed to Poor Jimmy’s former assistant [[Patricia]], though she seems unsure whether she will reopen the business at all.
