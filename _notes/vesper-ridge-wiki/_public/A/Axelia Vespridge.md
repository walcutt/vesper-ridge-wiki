title: Axelia Vespridge
---

The leading lady of House Vespridge and formally the second most powerful person in the city. For reasons unknown, the Duke is highly reclusive and rarely appears in public, so the Duchess acts as the face of House Vespridge. She frequently appears at Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council assemblies and in high society gatherings.

Additionally, Duchess Axelia is the formal leader of the Constabulary, which effectively makes her a general in charge of the cityâ€™s armed forces. Kind of a girlboss.
