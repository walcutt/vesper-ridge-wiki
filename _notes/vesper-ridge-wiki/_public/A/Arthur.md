Older brother to [[Oliver]]. Arthur is a fisherman who lives by himself near [[The Dockyards]]. He spends his nights trawling for fish while the air is [[Rhodofolia|breathable]], and his days selling his catch in the [[Harbor Ward]].

Whether the result of a grudge or just sheer misfortune, Arthur found himself briefly held hostage as part of [[Black Light Mining Company|Black Light]] retaliation against the [[Dockworkers Union|Dockworkersâ€™ Union]] during Chapter II of our story. Fortunately for him, our party came to his rescue.
