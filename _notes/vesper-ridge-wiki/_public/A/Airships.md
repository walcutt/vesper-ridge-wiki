title: Airships
---

These flying vehicles are powered by steam engines and held aloft by balloons of gas. Most of a vehicle is entirely non-magical, but the control mechanisms are enchanted. Custom models may also feature additional magical systems at the clientâ€™s request. Airships are rare in [[The Hallowed Lands]], and [[Vesper Ridge]] is thought to be the only city currently producing them.
