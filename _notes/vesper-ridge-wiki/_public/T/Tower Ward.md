title: Tower Ward
---

The oldest part of Vesper Ridge, located in the center of the city. The Tower Ward is home to many of the city’s landmarks, including the ducal Castle Vespridge, the Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council offices, the Cathedral of Guiding Light, Amber Grove Park and of course the Clocktower itself.

The phrase “Tower Ward” does not appear in any laws or official documents. Technically it is called the Municipal Administrative Ward, but nobody outside the halls of the Parliamentary Council calls it that.
