title: Twin Gates
---

Located between the constabulary’s mustering grounds and the city proper, these two gates see most of the city’s land-based industrial traffic. Despite their proximity to the mustering grounds and the Sunset Ward, much effort is put into keeping the Twin Gates presentable and welcoming, since wealthier travelers from abroad often pass through these gates on their way to the Southern Ward. Of course, the richest travelers enter the city either through the Velvet Ward’s High Gates or by airship.
