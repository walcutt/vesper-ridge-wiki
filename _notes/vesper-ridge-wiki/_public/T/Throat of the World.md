title: Throat of the World
---

The colloquial name for the largest vertical [[The Labyrinth|Labyrinth]] tunnel that connects to the surface. Having opened up directly in the central [[Tower Ward]] 220 years ago, it was long seen as a terrible nuisance before being covered over by the [[Cathedral of Guiding Light]] and then later converted into a mine shaft in use by [[Iron Caseval]]’s [[The Delving Guild|Delving Guild]].

Nobody remembers how it got its name.
