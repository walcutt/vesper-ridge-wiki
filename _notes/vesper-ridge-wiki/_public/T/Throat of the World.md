title: Throat of the World
---

The colloquial name for the largest vertical Labyrinth tunnel that connects to the surface. Having opened up directly in the central Tower Ward 220 years ago, it was long seen as a terrible nuisance before being covered over by the Cathedral of Guiding Light and then later converted into a mine shaft in use by Iron Casevalâ€™s Delving Guild.

Nobody remembers how it got its name.
