A towering dragon with stony flesh and great jagged jaws. His four eyes glow an eerie blue and his acidic breath melts flesh and iron alike. Together with the [[Faceless Hunchback]] he lurked in the abandoned [[Darcy Glassworks]] building, apparently engaged in some scheme involving a captured priest of the [[The Church of the Guiding Way|Guiding Way]], though it was interrupted by the valiant efforts of our party.
