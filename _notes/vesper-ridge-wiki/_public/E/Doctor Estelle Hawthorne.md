title: Doctor Estelle Hawthorne
---

A sketchy-looking woman who tends to shut herself away within her townhouse. Claims to be the best surgeon in [[Vesper Ridge]], but conducts her operations in what appears to be a modified bathroom. Is this really okay...?

Despite her skill as a physician, she always looks a bit ill herself. Clammy, pale, with darting eyes and an uncanny manner of moving, she often scares away potential patients. Her appearance brings to mind the image of a weasel.

According to [[Rook]], Dr. Hawthorne commits a lot of petty crimes. Heâ€™s even heard rumors that she was once caught attempting a burglary.
