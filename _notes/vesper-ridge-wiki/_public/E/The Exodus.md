title: The Exodus
---

The name given to the voyage across the Great Sea made some 240 years ago by thousands of elves. In the centuries since the Exodus, no sailors from the Hallowed Lands have managed to replicate the journey, and no one except the survivors of the original Exodus knows how it was made, or the nature of the land they left behind.
