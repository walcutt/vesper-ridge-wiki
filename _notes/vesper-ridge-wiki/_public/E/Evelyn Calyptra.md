---

The enigmatic leading lady of [[House Calyptra]], and one of the leading figures of the [[Vesper Ridge]] [[nobility]]. She is seldom seen outside Calyptra Manor. Her ambitions, how she spends her time, and how she amassed her fortune are all a mystery.

Even among the [[aristocracy]] she is seen as unapproachable, even frightening.
