(Note: I know you know what elves are, but this glossary entry exists to describe their unique place in this setting.)

Elves are a long-lived, humanoid race not native to [[the Hallowed Lands]]. They first arrived on the continent 240 years before the events of our story, sailing across the [[Great Sea]] in a great [[The Exodus|exodus]] from their mysterious homeland. In those 240 years, not a single one of those emigrant elves has told the people of the Hallowed Lands what they left behind or why they left it. To everyone else, it is unknown whether these mysterious foreigners refuse to explain their past from stubbornness or pride, or whether theyâ€™re somehow barred from speaking of it. Either way, many natives to the Hallowed Lands distrust elves because of this secrecy.

Younger elves born in the Hallowed Lands since the exodus universally claim not to know the secret.
