A "mad scientist" artificer who buys and sells various quirky gadgets at the [[Black Market]]. He has a real knack for his craft, and his inventions are often quite useful, but he believes that engineering is "more of an art than a science" and seldom bothers to include any kind of fail-safe in his designs. His products are sold at a discount, on account of the explosions.
