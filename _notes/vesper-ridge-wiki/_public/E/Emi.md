title: Emi
---

The oldest of the orphans living at [[Cairwick Chapel|Cairwick]], at 13 years of age. She watches over the younger children, who see her as something of a big sister. Emi helps out with housekeeping chores around the church, and helps prepare meals when it's [[Sister Linia|Linia]]’s turn to cook.

Emi sometimes squabbles with [[Rook]], but the two have a strong bond due to their shared willingness to do whatever it takes to protect their found family.

Equipped with a pistol and an adventurous spirit, she’s keen on solving the mystery of the [[Bloody Butterfly|Bloody Butterfly's]] identity. So keen, in fact, that she tailed the killer after [[Poor Jimmy Ashcroft|Poor Jimmy’s]] murder, and led the party to the site of another [[Supplicant|bloody ritual]] at a [[Cortis|local funeral home]], where together they discovered some concerning new clues.

On the way back home, Emi told the party about a local [[black market]] that she sometimes visits with Rook. Apparently, all sorts of fascinating things can be purchased there.
