title: The Prism Rifle
---

A magical rifle unlike anything known to modern engineering. It is long and sleek, and the hues of its wood and metal both seem to subtly shift each time light falls upon them. For the most part, it is built like a typical rifle: barrel, sights, trigger, stock, bolt action. But one highly unusual feature sets it apart: a crystalline sphere, fist-sized and iridescent with countless shimmering colors, is embedded where the firing mechanism should be. The gun's "chamber" is a narrow opening in the crystal itself, such that the bolt chambers bullets directly into the sphere.

Our party found the Prism Rifle not far from [[The Gloaming Lantern]] immediately after Ophile’s death and the lantern’s subsequent rewinding of [[The Clocktower|the clock]].
