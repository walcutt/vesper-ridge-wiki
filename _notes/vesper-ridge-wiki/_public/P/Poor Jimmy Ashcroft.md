title: Poor Jimmy Ashcroft
---

A very anxious wizard currently helping out at [[Cairwick Chapel]]. He would rather be somewhere else right now.

Specifically, he fears he may be hunted by the [[Bloody Butterfly]] and wants to flee the city as fast as he possibly can. In recent days Poor Jimmy has been in hiding at Cairwick, writing letters and getting his affairs in order as he and [[Rook]] attempt to find a [[Permit of Leave]].
