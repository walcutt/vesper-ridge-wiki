title: Pigeons Eaves Row

A narrow residential street in the [[Harbor Ward]], close to the [[Old River]] and the edge of the [[Sunset Ward]]. This humble streetâ€™s most outstanding feature is the stately but dilapidated silhouette of the former [[Cairwick Orphanage]], now called [[Cairwick Chapel]] or [[the Chapel of Second Chances]], a building that is cause for thoroughly mixed feelings among its neighbors.
