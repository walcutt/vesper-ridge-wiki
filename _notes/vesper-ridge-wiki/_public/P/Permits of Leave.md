title: Permits of Leave
---

A document issued by the [[Vesper Ridge Customs and Notary Bureau|Customs and Notary Bureau]] to allow passage out of the city. Its true purpose is less for keeping track of the flow of citizens and more to serve as red tape trapping bodies in the city so their labor can be more easily exploited.

[[Rook]] and [[Poor Jimmy Ashcroft|Poor Jimmy]] plotted to steal one of these documents from a certain [[Supervisor Argrave]] of the [[Black Light Mining Company]]; apparently in order to leave the city, the name on the document is much less important than the presence of the document itself. Though Poor Jimmy did not live long enough to take advantage of the Permit, Rook suggested that it may still be quite valuable to the party.
