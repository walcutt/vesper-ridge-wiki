title: Poppy
---

A seller of poisons and antidotes at the [[Black Market]]. Her skin and hair are both visibly damp. She looks clammy and perhaps a bit unwell, with unusually large eyes that constantly seem to be watering. She sniffles between sentences, even when she’s in a fine mood.

Poppy would like to make sure you’re prepared in the event you become poisoned.
