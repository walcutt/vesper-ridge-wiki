title: Patricia
---

An elderly human lady from the [[Southern Ward]], and current proprietor of [[Ashcroft's Antiques|Ashcroft’s Antiques]]. She spent several years as [[Poor Jimmy Ashcroft|Poor Jimmy]]’s assistant despite being by far the elder of the two, claiming she “just prefers an easier job.” Unlike Poor Jimmy, Patricia commands no magic of her own, and thus feels that she’s at no risk of being hunted by the [[Bloody Butterfly|Butterfly]]. Even if the magical trinkets in her shop were to draw the Butterfly’s attention, Patricia wouldn’t mind it overmuch. Death doesn’t trouble her.

Like many [[Vesperite|Vesperites]], Patricia is a follower of [[The Church of the Guiding Way|the Guiding Way]], and refuses to associate with the faith of [[Sister Linia|Sister Linia’s]] “[[Our Lady of the Black Rose|dark goddess]].” Linia doesn’t seem to mind.
