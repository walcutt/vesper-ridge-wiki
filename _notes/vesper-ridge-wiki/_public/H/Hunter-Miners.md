title: Hunter-Miners
---

A lucrative but highly dangerous new profession that has arisen as part of the [[tallow revolution]]. Called “hunters” due to the nature of their task, and called “miners” due to the subterranean [[The Labyrinth|Labyrinth]] in which they carry it out, though very little “mining” in the traditional sense occurs in those caverns. Some hunter-miners are self-employed or contract workers, but the majority of them work (sometimes indentured) for the [[tallow guilds]], especially [[Black Light Mining Company|Black Light]] and [[the Delving Guild]].

Hunter-mining carries the highest mortality rate of any profession in the city, but [[Vesper Ridge]]’s economic progress depends on it. As such, there are always new recruits to join the ranks of the tallow guilds. And if not enough new hunter-miners show up willingly, they will be found through other means.
