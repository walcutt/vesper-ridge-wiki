title: House Kerrifer
---

Fourth in status among the [[High Noble Houses]], though its members tend to test the limits of the respect garnered by their position in the hierarchy. House Kerrifer boasts a strong tradition of patronage for the arts and sciences, including significant contributions to [[Carrowmoor University]]’s endowment.

The current leading Lady, [[Ofelia Kerrifer]], is known to offer her financial backing to aspiring artists and inventors who can manage to win her favor, a feat that is often attempted but rarely achieved.

House Kerrifer’s symbol is a galloping horse.
