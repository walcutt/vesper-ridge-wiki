title: The Hallowed Lands
---

A vast continent surrounded on all sides by the Great Sea. Its southern end is a frozen tundra; its western reaches are highlands occupied by the Holy Kingdom of Alinor, and many cities to the east are under the banner of the Lirian Confederation. Situated upon the Sea of Wine at the continentâ€™s northern edge and directly between the two rival nations, the independent city-state of Vesper Ridge occupies an economically advantageous but politically precarious location.

Lands across the Great Sea are largely unknown, though it is common knowledge that the homeland of the elves was once somewhere to the north.
