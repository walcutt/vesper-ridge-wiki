title: House Hypatia
---

Sixth in status among the [[High Noble Houses]], and a notable oddity in that its current Lord, [[Calix Hypatia]], is not a human but an [[Elves|elf]]. His adoptive father, the previous (human) Lord of House Hypatia, never married or had his own children and chose to adopt a son in order to continue the family line.

In [[Vesperite]] society, which shuns and distrusts elves, this choice of heir was highly controversial, and there is still much gossip and speculation among the aristocracy as to the late Lord Hypatia’s motives for such a choice. One popular theory is that Calix was chosen because an elf’s centuries-long lifespan will afford him ample time to build a large family and ensure House Hypatia’s continued prosperity.

House Hypatia traces its roots back to the [[Holy Kingdom of Alinor]], relocating to [[Vesper Ridge]] about a hundred years into the city’s history. For most of that time, the Hypatia family maintained good relations with the ruling [[House Vespridge]], but it seems tension has mounted between the two houses during the reign of Lord Calix.

It seems that our very own Ophile Evenstar may have a connection to this family...

The building itself, known as Hypatia Manor, is a palatial Rococo-style estate deep within the opulent [[Velvet Ward]], and well-staffed by a legion of servants all outfitted in accordance with Lord Calix’s rather eccentric fashion tastes.

House Hypatia’s symbol is a flying hawk with wings aflame.
