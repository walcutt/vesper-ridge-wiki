title: House Hypatia
---

Sixth in status among the High Noble Houses, and a notable oddity in that its current Lord, Calix Hypatia, is not a human but an elf. His adoptive father, the previous (human) Lord of House Hypatia, never married or had his own children and chose to adopt a son in order to continue the family line.

In Vesperite society, which shuns and distrusts elves, this choice of heir was highly controversial, and there is still much gossip and speculation among the aristocracy as to the late Lord Hypatia’s motives for such a choice. One popular theory is that Calix was chosen because an elf’s centuries-long lifespan will afford him ample time to build a large family and ensure House Hypatia’s continued prosperity.

House Hypatia’s symbol is a flying hawk with wings aflame.
