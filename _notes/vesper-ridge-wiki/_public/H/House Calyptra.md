title: House Calyptra
---

Fifth in status among the High Noble Houses, and ruled by the mysterious Lady Evelyn Calyptra. Little is known about the inner workings of House Calyptra, and most residents of the city give Lady Evelyn’s property a wide berth.

According to legend, a grisly murder occurred some twenty years ago in the Velvet Ward when a burglar attempted to break into the Calyptra manor. Various versions of the tale are told, but most involve lurid descriptions of necromancy or human sacrifice. Whether any of these tales are true is anyone’s guess.

House Calyptra’s symbol is a moth surrounded by a wreath.
