title: House Vespridge
---

The family of the Duke and Duchess [[Ainsley Vespridge|Ainsley]] and [[Axelia Vespridge]], and the highest in peerage among all the [[High Noble Houses]] of the city. House Vespridge traces its lineage directly back to [[Morian Vespridge|Baron Morian Vespridge]], the founder of the city, and claims its legitimacy to rule through this blood connection.

Matters of public policy are largely left to the [[Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council]], though Duke Vespridge enjoys veto power over all new legislation before it is put into effect. Additionally, House Vespridge (like all eight High Noble Houses) directly appoints some members of the VRPC to their seats at the start of each term. All public land in [[Vesper Ridge]] is technically property of House Vespridge.

[[Chambermaid Calliope]] serves House Vespridge, and stated that she was on an errand for the Duke and Duchess when the party encountered her in the [[Harbor Ward]]. Though Calliope worships [[Our Lady of the Black Rose]], House Vespridge itself has no association with the goddess, rather maintaining the official position that all religions aside from [[the Church of the Guiding Way]] are to be dissuaded (though not outright banned) within Vesper Ridge.

House Vespridgeâ€™s symbol is a hornet in flight.
