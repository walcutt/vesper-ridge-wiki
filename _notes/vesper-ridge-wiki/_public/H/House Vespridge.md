title: House Vespridge
---

The family of the Duke and Duchess Ainsley and Axelia Vespridge, and the highest in peerage among all the High Noble Houses of the city. House Vespridge traces its lineage directly back to Baron Morian Vespridge, the founder of the city, and claims its legitimacy to rule through this blood connection.

Matters of public policy are largely left to the Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council, though Duke Vespridge enjoys veto power over all new legislation before it is put into effect. Additionally, House Vespridge (like all eight High Noble Houses) directly appoints some members of the VRPC to their seats at the start of each term.

All public land in Vesper Ridge is technically property of House Vespridge. House Vespridgeâ€™s symbol is a hornet in flight.
