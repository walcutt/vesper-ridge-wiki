title: Harbor Ward
---

The northwest corner of Vesper Ridge and one of the older areas of the city. Some of the first permanent homes of its old settlers were built here along the Sea of Wine, long before the plague of rhodofolia rendered the waterfront uninhabitable. To this day, the Harbor Ward’s fishing industry remains the core of its economy, although in modern times it is heavily supplemented by shipping, masonry, and metalworking.

The Harbor Ward is one of the poorest areas of the city, and rows of dilapidated tenement buildings shelter dense concentrations of workers and their families, their hundreds of smokestacks raining soot gently down onto the city streets. Despite their squalor, the people of the Harbor Ward foster a strong sense of community, aided by organizations like the Dockworkers’ Union. In recent years, however, the strength of this community has been tested by the rapid industrialization of the Tallow Revolution and the constant encroachments of the Black Light Mining Company.

The Old River runs through the Harbor Ward on its way to the Sea of Wine.
