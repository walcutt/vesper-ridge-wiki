title: Hunter-Miner's Tools
---

Mechanically, a special set of artisan’s tools with which most [[Hunter-Miner|hunter-miners]] are proficient. This kit contains butcher's knives and cleavers of varying size and weight, carving forks, syringes (to relieve [[cave horrors]] of their undesirable fluids), a hammer and chisel (to puncture protective shells), and a hefty leather sack (to carry [[Tallow|the fat]] back up to the surface). If larger beasts are to be hunted, the leather sack may be substituted with a cart, but usually the larger horrors are left well alone. Additionally, most hunter-miners bring along a gas mask, because many cave horrors’ bodies release noxious fumes when cut open.
