title: Hymns for the Blossoming
---

A three-volume set of ancient, highly esoteric scriptures of the [[Our Lady of the Black Rose|Church of the Black Rose]]. Two centuries ago, the man who would become [[The Old Man Upstairs]] hid them in an [[The Labyrinth|underground]] shrine. He was killed shortly thereafter, and the Hymns sat forgotten until our party returned them to the surface.

The scriptures are dense and are written to deliberately confound the readerâ€™s understanding, so analyzing them is a slow and difficult process. However, their dusty old pages promise many rewards for the patient scholar, including myriad insights into the gospel of the Black Rose, magical secrets, and even divine blessings from Our Lady herself.
