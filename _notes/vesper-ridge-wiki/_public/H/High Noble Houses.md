title: High Noble Houses
---

The eight most influential noble families of [[Vesper Ridge]]. [[House Vespridge]] rules over all others, but the remaining seven houses have an informal hierarchy among them as well, enforced by tradition and etiquette rather than law. For player reference, the hierarchy goes: Vespridge, [[House Pendleton|Pendleton]], [[House Colfax|Colfax]], [[House Kerrifer|Kerrifer]], [[House Calyptra|Calyptra]], [[House Hypatia|Hypatia]], [[House von Helzen|von Helzen]], [[House Quillix|Quillix]]. Each of the eight houses is charged with appointing representatives to three seats of the [[Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council]], collectively accounting for 24 of the councilâ€™s 47 seats.
