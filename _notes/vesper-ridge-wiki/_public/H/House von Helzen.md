title: House von Helzen
---

Seventh in status among the [[High Noble Houses]], and the house most closely aligned with [[the Church of the Guiding Way]]. Due to their close ties with the church, the von Helzen family’s formal matriarchs and patriarchs are traditionally blessed with the title of Saint, and canonized as such by Guiding Way gospel. House von Helzen has a storied past, having played a crucial role in establishing organized worship of [[the Keeper]] in [[Vesper Ridge]] as well as mediating relations between Vesper Ridge and the [[Holy Kingdom of Alinor]].

In recent years, however, the von Helzens have found themselves in disarray. The [[Cathedral of Guiding Light]]’s infamous scandal a decade ago deeply stained House von Helzen’s reputation, and just several weeks before the beginning of Dim Light, the house’s ruling Lord Richart von Helzen was assassinated by the Bloody Butterfly. In the days since the killing, Richart’s sister [[Saint-Steward Eliza von Helzen|Eliza]] has held temporary stewardship as head of House von Helzen as the nobles and their servants scramble to prepare an impromptu debut ceremony for Richart’s oldest son, 17-year- old [[Darius von Helzen]].

House von Helzen’s symbol is three stars above a flowing silver river.
