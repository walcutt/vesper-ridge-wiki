title: Haemoaquea
---

A common but dangerous viral disease in which the patient's blood gradually thins and turns to water. Many of the giant rats that infest the poorer wards of the city are known to be carriers. Because haemoaquea is so common, most doctors in Vesper Ridge are experienced in treating it, and effective medicines are widely available. If a patient receives proper care within a few days of contracting the disease, death is exceedingly unlikely. It is not contagious.
