title: House Quillix
---

Least in status and humblest among the [[High Noble Houses]], though to be a High Noble House at all is itself enough to place one leagues above the rest of [[Vesperite]] society. Even so, House Quillix is generally regarded as more in touch with the common people than the rest of the [[nobility]]. The house’s head, eccentric [[Rogier Quillix|Lord Rogier Quillix]], spends his days as the manager of the [[Velvet Ward Public Library]] and freely interacts with the public as they browse the library’s collections.

House Quillix’s symbol is an owl perched upon a branch.
