House Colfax: Third in status among the [[High Noble Houses]], and run more like a business than a noble family. House Colfax is ruled by [[Cooper Colfax|Lord Cooper Colfax]], though he spurns his noble title and prefers to be addressed as simply Mr. Colfax.

House Colfax is incredibly wealthy, enjoying massive profits from the [[Colfax Dirigible Enterprise]]’s [[Airships|airship]] sales. Additionally, due to the Enterprise’s current monopoly on airship production, House Colfax has considerable leverage over the transportation industry as a whole.

House Colfax’s symbol is a winged serpent baring its fangs.
