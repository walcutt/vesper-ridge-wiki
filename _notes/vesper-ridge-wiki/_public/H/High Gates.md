title: High Gates
---

Named for the hill upon which they stand, these ornate gates lead into the opulent [[Velvet Ward]]. All but the most important of visitors are turned away, redirected to the various other city entrances. The [[Aristocracy|residents]] of the Velvet Ward do not, as a general rule, abide the presence of commoners in their midst.
