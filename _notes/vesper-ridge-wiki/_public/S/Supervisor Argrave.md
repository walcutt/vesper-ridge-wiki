title: Supervisor Argrave
---

A mid-level [[Black Light Mining Company|Black Light]] boss, a manager of personnel and industrial goods on the [[Harbor Ward]] waterfront. He recently filed for a [[Permits of Leave]] and intended to flee the city, until Catalin stole the document and left him bleeding on the floor of his office.

On his desk, the party found a letter addressed to Argrave by an individual known only as “[[The Mysterious H|H]].” This letter, which strongly implied a threat to Argrave’s life, was likely the reason he sought to flee [[Vesper Ridge]].
