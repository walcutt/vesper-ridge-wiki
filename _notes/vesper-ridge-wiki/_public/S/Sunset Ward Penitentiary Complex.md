title: Sunset Ward Penitentiary Complex
---

The largest prison in [[Vesper Ridge]], originally constructed as a dungeon under a city fortress that no longer exists. In the fortâ€™s place until recently stood the [[Vesper Ridge Customs and Notary Bureau River Gates Branch Municipal Office|Customs and Notary Bureau River Gates Branch Municipal Office]], which did indeed condemn many unfortunate [[Vesperite|Vesperites]] to an uncomfortable stay in the underground penitentiary when they fail to procure the necessary [[Permit of Stay]] in a timely fashion after first entering the city. These prisoners are often drafted for public works such as railroad maintenance and coal mining.

In addition to those poor indentured servants, the Sunset Ward Penitentiary Complex houses individuals awaiting trial for various charges and some convicts serving out long-term sentences.

Vesper Ridge has no capital punishment laws, but rumors insist there exists an execution chamber somewhere in the dungeon.
