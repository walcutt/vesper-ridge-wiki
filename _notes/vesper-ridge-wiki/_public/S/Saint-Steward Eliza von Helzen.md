title: Saint-Steward Eliza von Helzen

As sister to the late Saint Richart von Helzen, Eliza was to be the interim leading lady of the noble [[House von Helzen]] until her young nephew [[Darius von Helzen|Darius]] completes his formal education and ascends to the role of Saint. However, unthinkably, Saint-Steward Eliza has now also met an [[Bloody Butterfly|untimely end]], throwing the already troubled von Helzen line into further disarray.
