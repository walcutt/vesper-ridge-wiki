title: Sister Linia
---

A frail priestess to a [[Our Lady of the Black Rose|heretical goddess]] with one working leg, a gaggle of orphans to look after, and a whole [[The Chapel of Second Chances|church]] to run. She is very tired.

Sister Linia struggles to shoulder the amount of responsibility that rests on her shoulders, and her weak left leg doesn't make matters any easier on her. Still, she manages to find time to pray to Our Lady of the Black Rose and hold daily services in [[Cairwick Chapel|Cairwick]]’s dining hall-turned-chapel. Fortunately for Linia, [[Rook]] and [[Leonora]] both do their best to help out around the church, preparing meals and doing laundry and cleaning up messes. But neither are particularly skilled at dealing with children, so most of the interpersonal work falls to Sister Linia.

Though her abilities as a cleric are middling at best, Linia has knowledge of ancient ritual magic that allowed her to bestow blessings upon multiple members of our party. Or, more accurately, to facilitate the exchange of blessings that our party members chose to bestow upon each other. Despite the nurturing nature of her goddess, the process of Linia’s ritual is rather morbid.

She is a terrible cook.
