title: Saint Octavia's Church
---

A small but opulent [[The Church of the Guiding Way|Guiding Way]] church located not far from the former [[Cathedral of Guiding Light]] in the central [[Tower Ward]]. Though diminutive in size, Saint Octavia’s is considered a deeply holy site due to the presence of its namesake’s remains interred within its underground crypt. According to some records, Saint Octavia may have dwelt here during her lifetime as well.

When the grand cathedral was (unconscionably) lost in the infamous deal with [[Iron Caseval]], Saint Octavia’s Church was chosen as the new seat of [[The Keeper]]’s faith within [[Vesper Ridge]]. After the cathedral’s “fall” and the transfer of power, a dense row of trees was conspicuously planted along the edge of Saint Octavia’s churchyard that had until then provided a view of the cathedral across [[Forum Square]].

In Chapter III of our story, Ophile consulted the church’s archives under strict supervision, researching the subject of [[Demons]].
