title: Searchlights
---

Encountered by the party in the [[Harbor Ward]], and later in [[The Mediastinum]], this 15-foot-tall abomination resembled a haphazard, vaguely humanoid assortment of machinery, pipes, rebar, earth and clay. In place of a head, it bore a twisting rubbery tube that emitted a blinding light, which seemed to carry various magical properties. Rather than walk, it hovered just above the ground, and a strange ethereal glow poured forth from its entire body like vapor off of dry ice.

For reasons unknown, the Searchlight had been following [[Chambermaid Calliope|Calliope]] through the city, seemingly invisible to everyone else, until the party heard the sounds of their fight and helped the maid slay it. [[Emi]], who was also present, said she could not see or hear the slightest trace of its presence.

The second searchlight’s presence was even more enigmatic, seeming to claw its way into existence before our party’s very eyes within the strange, otherworldly chamber of the Mediastinum. Both searchlights were equally hostile.
