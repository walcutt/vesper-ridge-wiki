title: Sunset Coal Mine
---

Despite the ubiquity of so-called “[[Hunter-Miners|hunter-miners]]” in [[Vesper Ridge]], there is only one true mine within the city. And unlike the subterranean hunting grounds of the [[tallow guilds]], the Sunset Coal Mine operates as a mine in the most traditional sense.

Together, the Sunset Coal Mine and the nearby [[Black Light Mining Company|Black Light]] headquarters are responsible for a significant portion of the filth that coats the hapless [[Sunset Ward]].
