title: Scar Blight
---

A disease spread by bacteria that accumulate on rotting tissue. The primary symptoms are bright red lesions that develop on the patient's limbs and torso, which become highly sensitive to physical contact. Often described as incredibly painful, Scar Blight has a fearsome reputation despite its generally mild prognosis. With proper treatment, a patient is almost guaranteed to recover, but the lesions leave permanent circular scars on the skin.
