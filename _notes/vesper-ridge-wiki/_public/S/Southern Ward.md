title: Southern Ward
---

As one might guess by its name, this ward encompasses much of the southern portion of [[Vesper Ridge]]. It is relatively clean and contains many restaurants and inns, as well as small shops and markets peddling trinkets to visitors to the city. Most residents of the Southern Ward live in humble but comfortable townhouses and work in light industry such as textiles or bakeries.

The [[Twin Gates]] at the southernmost end of this neighborhood serve as a common entry point for visitors to the city, so much effort is made by the Southern Ward Council to keep the ward attractive and presentable. As such, the Southern Wardâ€™s streets are lined with quaint parks rather than the factories and refineries typical of the neighboring [[Sunset Ward|Sunset]] and [[Foundry Ward|Foundry Wards]].
