A large aquatic creature, more or less cephalopod in appearance, which apparently lurks within the [[Sea of Wine]]. Encountered by our party in Chapter II during a [[Black Light Mining Company|Black Light]] attack on [[The Dockyards]], this monstrosity seeks to lure its victims into the [[Rhodofolia]]- choked waters via telepathic suggestions.
