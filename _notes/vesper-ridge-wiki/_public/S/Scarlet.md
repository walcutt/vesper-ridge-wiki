title: Scarlet
---

A human girl living at [[Cairwick Chapel]], and a bit of a loner. Scarlet is 8 years old, and has spent the past year quietly lurking in the church after [[Emi]] coaxed her in off the street one early morning. Her eyes are cloudy, and her face is covered in burn scars. She does not smile, but she never complains either.

Scarlet can often be found standing quietly at the edge of a room, or just outside the door, watching the other children play together but never joining in.

Despite her unapproachable demeanor, it seems she isn’t completely immune to having fun. After considerable coaxing, Juniper and [[Vicky Lu]] did manage to convince her to play a single board game with them. Perhaps she even enjoyed it.

Scarlet is a spellcaster, though she’s kept this fact hidden from everyone until quite recently. Due to her magic, she fears she’ll become a target of the [[Bloody Butterfly]], and seemingly plans to take matters dangerously into her own hands if the party does not ensure her safety.
