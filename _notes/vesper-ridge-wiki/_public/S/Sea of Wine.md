title: Sea of Wine
---

A long, narrow bay of the Great Sea that cuts into the Hallowed Lands’ northern coastline. Historically known as “Vesper Bay” after the city, it has over time become known by its modern name due to the striking red hue of its water during the daylight hours.
In the time of Baron Morian Vespridge, the Sea of Wine was teeming with edible fish and far kinder to settlers than the surrounding Barrens, supporting a burgeoning Vesper Ridge as it grew into the city it is today. For those first several hundred years, the waters were clean and relatively safe to sail. However, as the great city upon the shore began to industrialize, the deadly rhodofolia began to cloud the bay, growing thicker by the year.
