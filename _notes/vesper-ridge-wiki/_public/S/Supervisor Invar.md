title: Supervisor Invar
---

A mid-level [[Black Light Mining Company|Black Light]] boss, slain by our party in [[The Dockyards]] during a gunfight between Black Light mercenaries and [[Dockworkers Union|dockworkers]]. His exact role within the company prior to his death is unclear. Invar’s performance in combat was being monitored (and judged) by the [[Bloody Butterfly]]. The Butterfly’s threats, coupled with our party’s superiority in combat, set Invar fleeing (unsuccessfully) for his life during his last moments in this world.
