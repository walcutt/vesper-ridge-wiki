title: Supplicants
---

The name of a malformed sort of creature discovered by the party in the basement morgue below [[Cortis|Cortis’s]] funeral home. Though the supplicants’ exact nature is unknown, their jagged teeth and nails, burning hot breath, and mess of scar tissue in place of eyes or noses clearly mark them as something unnatural. According to Cortis’s testimony, they were created by the [[Bloody Butterfly]].
