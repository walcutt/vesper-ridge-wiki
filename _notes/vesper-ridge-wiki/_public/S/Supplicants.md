title: Supplicants
---

Malformed creatures discovered by our party in the basement morgue below [[Cortis]]’s funeral home. Formerly innocent people of [[The Hallowed Lands]], these abominations have been twisted by the [[Bloody Butterfly]] through magic unknown, born anew in fire and pain. Their jagged teeth and nails, burning hot breath, and eyeless scarred faces are suited for little other than carrying out their master’s grisly agenda.
