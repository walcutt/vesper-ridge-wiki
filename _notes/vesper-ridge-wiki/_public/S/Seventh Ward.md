title: Seventh Ward

The northern, central area of Vesper Ridge, including all the urban shoreline not sectioned off into the Harbor Ward by the Old River, as well as several other important landmarks such as Carrowmoor University and the Colfax Dirigible Enterpriseâ€™s Airshipyards. Formerly a part of the Tower Ward, this area was separated into its own ward so that sanitation and safety regulations affecting its many laboratories and factories could be cut to bolster productivity without tarnishing the clean and beautiful image of the wealthy Tower Ward.
