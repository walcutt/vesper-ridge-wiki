title: Sunset Ward
---

The densely populated southwestern region of Vesper Ridge.

The Sunset Ward gets its name from the way the last rays of evening sunlight seem to linger on its streets after the rest of the city falls into darkness, though in recent years the clouds of smoke from its many factories tend to dampen the effect. This part of the city is generally poor, dirty, and loud.

The headquarters of the Black Light Mining Company, and the largest Labyrinth entrance it owns, take up a full city block in this ward, located not far from the only true mine (a coal mine) within the city limits. Though the Old River only flows through the Harbor Ward, the nearby River Gates and the Notary Bureauâ€™s corresponding River Gates Branch Office are both technically within the Sunset Ward.
