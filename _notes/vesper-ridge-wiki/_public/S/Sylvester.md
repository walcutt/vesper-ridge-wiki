title: Sylvester

A talking umbrella, apparently. Ophile discovered him trapped with [[Dorothy]] in the depths of a magical purse from [[Ashcroft's Antiques|Ashcroft’s Antiques]], a plight ill-befitting a destined adventurer like him.

Sylvester’s build is reliable and sturdy, though his moss-green fabric is marred by a few mud stains. His ferrule and handle are both carved from smooth ebony that has suffered a few chips and scratches. Despite his weather-worn appearance, his springs and moving parts still operate perfectly. Sylvester’s personality is easygoing, playful, and a bit sarcastic.
