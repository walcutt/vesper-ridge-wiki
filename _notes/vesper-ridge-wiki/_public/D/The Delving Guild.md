title: The Delving Guild
---

The [[tallow]] mining company owned by [[Iron Caseval]], employing thousands of [[Hunter-Miners|hunter-miners]] and still growing rapidly. Among all the [[tallow guilds]], only the [[Black Light Mining Company]] has managed to keep pace with its growth, resorting to underhanded schemes and extortion to stay competitive with Casevalâ€™s monolith of a guild.

In contrast to Black Light, the Delving Guild maintains a respectable public image, although there do exist rumors of darker dealings behind closed doors.

Our party sold quite a sizable haul of cave horror fat to a clerk at the Delving Guild headquarters, and was offered an employment opportunity in return.
