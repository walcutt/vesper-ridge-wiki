title: The Delving Guild
---

The tallow mining company owned by Iron Caseval, employing thousands of hunter-miners and still growing rapidly. Among all the tallow guilds, only the Black Light Mining Company has managed to keep pace with its growth, resorting to underhanded schemes and extortion to stay competitive with Casevalâ€™s monolith of a guild.

In contrast to Black Light, the Delving Guild maintains a respectable public image, although there do exist rumors of darker dealings behind closed doors.
