Located deep within the [[Foundry Ward]], this abandoned factory used to quickly and efficiently produce great quantities of plate glass for new construction projects throughout [[Vesper Ridge]]. According to a letter penned by [[Calix Hypatia|Lord Calix Hypatia]], a witness to the burning of the [[Vesper Ridge Customs and Notary Bureau River Gates Branch Municipal Office|customs office]] is currently on the premises, in grave peril.

After arriving at the scene, our party did indeed find a man in grave peril... suspended in midair by blood-red sigils ominously similar to those painted by the [[Bloody Butterfly]] around [[Poor Jimmy Ashcroft|Poor Jimmyâ€™s]] corpse. Flanking the helpless man are two much larger figures: a massive dragon and some sort of faceless monstrosity, both of which have now turned their attention to the party.
