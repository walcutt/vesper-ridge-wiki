title: Dorothy

A talking umbrella, apparently. Ophile discovered her trapped with [[Sylvester]] in the depths of a magical purse from [[Ashcroft's Antiques|Ashcroft’s Antiques]], and Dorothy was most grateful to be rescued from her embroidered prison.

She’s rather stylish in appearance, with dark purple fabric and delicate gold embroidery around the perimeter of her canopy. Her ferrule and handle are both carved from shining ivory, and her whole body is light as a feather. When she speaks, the sound emanates loud and clear all around her, even though an umbrella certainly should not have any way of producing a voice. Her manner is graceful, refined, and a bit snobbish.

Dorothy seems deeply reluctant to be carried too deep into the [[Velvet Ward]], claiming to have “a bit of a history” with some of its residents. After some persuading by Catalin, she promised to reveal her past to the party together with [[Sylvester]].
