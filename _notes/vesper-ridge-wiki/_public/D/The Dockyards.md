title: The Dockyards
---

The portions of the [[Harbor Ward]] and [[Beacon Ward]] closest to the [[Sea of Wine]]. Due to the threat of [[rhodofolia]] poisoning, the dockyards are among the most dangerous areas of the city. Nevertheless, fishing and waterborne shipping are crucial industries for [[Vesper Ridge]], so the dockyards are always busy. Mask-clad longshoremen load and unload cargo onto ships by day, and fishing boats venture out into the bay to make their catch by night.
