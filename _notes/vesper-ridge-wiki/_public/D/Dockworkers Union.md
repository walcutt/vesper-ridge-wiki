title: Dockworkers Union
---

A collective of fishermen, longshoremen and other waterfront workers of the Harbor Ward. It was established fifteen years prior to the events of Dim Light. The Dockworkers’ Union, often abbreviated to ‘DU,’ ensures fair pay and basic workplace safety regulations for its members.

In addition to the purpose suggested by its title, this organization serves as a de facto militia resisting the Black Light Mining Company’s advances into the Harbor Ward. Because the bulk of Black Light’s business endeavors are more akin to mafia activity, the people of the Harbor Ward generally look favorably upon the Dockworkers’ Union, viewing them as protectors of the innocent.
