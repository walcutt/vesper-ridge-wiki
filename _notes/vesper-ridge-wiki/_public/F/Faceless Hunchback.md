title: Faceless Hunchback
---

A large, imposing monster encountered by our party in the abandoned [[Darcy Glassworks]] building. His appearance, mannerisms, and magic all shared similarities with those of the [[Bloody Butterfly]]. Though his identity and aims are unclear, he spoke of himself as royalty, and asked our party if they came to him as supplicants. Wherever he goes, fluttering ashes attend him.
