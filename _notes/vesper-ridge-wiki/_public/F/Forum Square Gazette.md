title: Forum Square Gazette
---

A widely circulated [[Vesperite]] newspaper named after the site of its publishing house, [[Forum Square]] in the central [[Tower Ward]]. Several papers enjoy widespread readership in [[Vesper Ridge]], but none capture the public’s imagination quite like the sensational storytelling of the Gazette’s writers.

The “[[Bloody Butterfly]]” moniker for Vesper Ridge’s mysterious serial killer was coined in a Forum Square Gazette article.
