title: Forsaken Spirits
---

[[Cave horrors]]. Frail, feeble, and quite timid. Each one looks like a pair of slender humanoids with whitish, waxy skin, embracing each other, but melded together into one body wherever they touch. Their arms around each other, their foreheads pressed together, their legs entangled in each other, they become one indistinct form. The forsaken spirit walks slowly, falteringly, toward anyone whose voice it hears. When itâ€™s been hurt, it stops moving and begins to wail, sending all nearby cave horrors into a violent frenzy.
