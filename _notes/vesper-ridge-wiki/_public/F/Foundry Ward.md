title: Foundry Ward
---

Comprising the southeastern corner of [[Vesper Ridge]], the Foundry Ward is the center of much of the cityâ€™s heavy industry. Most raw materials mined in the [[Sunset Ward]] or shipped into the city by rail end up here to be processed and then shipped to their final destinations. Beneath the city streets, the Foundry Ward is connected to the Sunset Ward and the [[Beacon Ward]] by several vital railway tunnels, the routes of which were carefully charted to avoid intersecting with any branches of [[the Labyrinth]]. On the surface, the Foundry Ward is also home to the railyards where new train cars are manufactured. There is little housing in this ward, largely because the awful smell and the constant cloud of smog blotting out the sun discourage just about anyone from spending more time here than is mandated by their work.
