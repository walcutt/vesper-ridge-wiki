title: Forum Square
---

The central square of the city, where the Clocktower stands. A gathering place for public events, and a frequent stopping point for visitors to the city thanks to its proximity to Amber Grove Park, the mysterious Clocktower, and the infamous Cathedral of Guiding Light. All of Vesper Ridgeâ€™s major newspapers distribute new issues here, most notably the popular Forum Square Gazette, which is headquartered right at the edge of the plaza.
