title: Leonora

Formerly a boutique doll maker from the [[Velvet Ward]], her business collapsed after she accidentally offended [[Ofelia Kerrifer|Lady Kerrifer]] and suddenly found herself ostracized from high society. Leonora ended up on [[Pigeons Eaves Row|Pigeon’s Eaves Row]] as she wandered aimlessly through the city a few days later, and the sound of soft singing drew her through the doors of [[Cairwick Chapel]] and into the audience of one of [[Sister Linia|Linia]]'s sermons. In need of a second chance herself, she took a liking to the [[Our Lady of the Black Rose|Black Rose]]’s philosophies and asked to stay for a while. Now she makes a living selling blankets and clothing at the morning market, and trades extra clothes for food for the church.

Leonora does not do well in a crisis, but she seems to relax whenever she’s practicing her craft.

After [[The Gloaming Lantern]] turned back time to save Ophile in the second chapter of our story, Leonora confided in Ophile that she’d seen uncanny dreams which, according to her, seemed to perfectly predict the events of the next day.
