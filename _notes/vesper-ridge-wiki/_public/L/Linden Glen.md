title: Linden Glen
---

The nearest foreign city to Vesper Ridge, situated near the eastern border of the Holy Kingdom of Alinor. Linden Glen stands in the midst of the great Lindenwood forest, the edge of which borders on the Barrens that surround Vesper Ridge. The Old River, which flows through Vesper Ridge near its terminus at the Sea of Wine, originates from a network of tiny streams in the Lindenwood.

Due to the two cities’ proximity, and the river that flows between them, Vesper Ridge sources most of its lumber from Linden Glen, and consequently a strong sense of economic partnership exists between them. Indeed, a great portion of Linden Glen’s economy depends on its lumber trade.
