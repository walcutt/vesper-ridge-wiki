title: Lirian Confederation
---

The large but rather incohesive country to the east of Vesper Ridge and the Barrens. The Lirian Confederation was formerly a unified kingdom known as Lirios (and often still referred to by its old moniker), established 650 years ago by towns banding together to resist the eastward expansion of the Holy Kingdom of Alinor.

Two centuries before the present day, Lirios underwent a populist revolution in which the monarchy was overthrown and a much weaker confederate government was put in place. It still remains technically a single unified nation, but most Lirian citizens feel a stronger loyalty to their local regions and individual cities. Additionally, the country’s legal code is extremely sparse compared to Alinor’s, and thus a great deal of activity that would be considered illegal in the west is conducted in Lirios. As such, it has developed a reputation as a lawless frontier, although in truth many of its cities are perfectly safe and orderly.
