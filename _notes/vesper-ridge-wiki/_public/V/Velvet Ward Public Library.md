title: Velvet Ward Public Library
---

Open every day of the year and a notable exception to the [[Velvet Ward]]’s oppressively snobbish atmosphere, the Velvet Ward Public Library welcomes visitors from all parts of the city and beyond. As a public institution, it is owned by the city, but the duties of its management have long been undertaken by the members of [[House Quillix]]. The house’s current Lord, [[Rogier Quillix]], relishes the work and spends almost all of his waking hours (and often his sleeping hours too) within the library’s maze of bookshelves.

The Velvet Ward Public Library has a reputation for being staffed by a group of rather eccentric people, Lord Quillix included; this reputation goes a long way toward keeping the more pretentious Velvet Ward [[Aristocracy|aristocrats]] away from its doorstep.
