title: Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council
---

Often shortened to “Parliament” or “the VRPC,” this is the highest governing body in the city. There are 47 seats on the council; 24 are appointed directly by the eight [[high noble houses]], and 23 are elected to represent various city wards in a semiannual vote. The [[Ainsley Vespridge|Duke]] and [[Axelia Vespridge|Duchess Vespridge]] have veto power on all legislation passed by Parliament. Parallel to the VRPC there exists a [[Vesper Ridge High Court|High Court]] with judges appointed by the Duke and Duchess Vespridge, and beneath these governing bodies exist many petty courts and bureaus of public servants that administer the city's daily hustle and bustle.

The VRPC’s most recent edict, issued just hours ago and currently being announced by mail couriers throughout the city, was a weighty one: a full lockdown of all city gates, effective immediately and indefinitely. Presently, the party has not learned Parliament’s reason for issuing such a decree.
