title: Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council
---

Often shortened to “Parliament” or “the VRPC,” this is the highest governing body in the city. There are 47 seats on the council; 24 are appointed directly by the eight high noble houses, and 23 are elected to represent various city wards in a semiannual vote. The Duke and Duchess Vespridge have veto power on all legislation passed by Parliament. Parallel to the VRPC there exists a High Court with judges appointed by the Duke and Duchess Vespridge, and beneath these governing bodies exist many petty courts and bureaus of public servants that administer the city's daily hustle and bustle.
