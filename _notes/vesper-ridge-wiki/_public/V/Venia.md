title: Venia
---

An enchanted holy relic of the Church of the [[Our Lady of the Black Rose|Black Rose]], found by our party in [[the Collectorâ€™s Warren]]. Venia is an immaculately polished silver brooch fashioned in the shape of a blossoming rose. Its petals and sepals are arranged in several concentric layers, fitted together with some mechanism that causes each layer to rotate at different speeds and in different directions when any one of them is spun. Whenever its petals move, Venia plays a faint melody like a music box. A small clasp on its posterior side allows it to be strung from a necklace or pinned directly onto one's clothing.
