title: Velvet Ward
---

Vesper Ridge’s northeastern neighborhood, and the wealthiest part of the city. Five of the eight High Noble Houses are found here, as well as most of the non-noble aristocracy. The Velvet Ward’s streets are quiet, spacious, and lined with flowering trees.

Residents of this ward tend to value privacy and propriety, adhering to an unspoken code of etiquette when in public, and great offense is taken when clueless outsiders fail to observe the proper manners.
