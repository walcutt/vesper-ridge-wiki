title: Vicky Lu
---

An orphaned goblin girl and the owner of Juniper before it gained sentience. She’s often underestimated due to her small stature, but Vicky Lu’s mind is as sharp as her little claws! Her special interest is linguistics, and she’s fluent in two languages and studying two more. She dreams of becoming an adventurer and a scholar when she grows up.

With Juniper’s help, she’s intent on getting [[Scarlet]] to come out of her shell!

After [[The Gloaming Lantern]] turned back time to save Ophile in the second chapter of our story, Vicky Lu expressed a sense that she had lived through that same day before.
