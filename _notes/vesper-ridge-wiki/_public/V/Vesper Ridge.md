title: Vesper Ridge
---

An independent city-state founded on unclaimed land between two rival nations. The cityâ€™s name is a bastardization of the name of the ruling Vespridge family.

Vesper Ridge has existed for about 370 years, growing from a humble fishing village into the wealthiest and most technologically advanced city on the continent. The city is currently in the middle of an unprecedented industrial revolution, and all eyes in the Hallowed Lands are watching it closely.

Vesper Ridge is divided into seven wards and managed at the city level by a representative Parliamentary Council and at the ward level by smaller Ward Councils.
