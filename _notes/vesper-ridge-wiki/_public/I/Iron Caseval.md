title: Iron Caseval

A [[beastfolk]] artificer who came to [[Vesper Ridge]] from [[Lirian Confederation|Lirios]] in the east, looking to find work in the [[Airships|airship]] industry as an engineer. After he was called to help salvage wreckage from a downed airship in the [[Barrens]], he became curious about the biology of a [[Cave Horrors|cave horror]] that had been killed when the ship broke through the brittle earth and partially collapsed a shallow [[The Labyrinth|Labyrinth]] tunnel outside the city. After some investigations he became even more interested, almost obsessive, and abandoned his job to explore the tunnels in search of more cave horrors to study. Former friends say he began to act like a madman... but his discoveries proved revolutionary, and soon he was pitching his [[tallow]]-based products to companies in the [[Foundry Ward]] and making enough money to hire [[Hunter-Miner|adventurers and mercenaries]] to collect more.

His company, [[the Delving Guild]], is the largest in the industry, and his secretaries say he’s never taken even a moment’s rest in his quest to turn the city’s gears ever faster with his creations.
