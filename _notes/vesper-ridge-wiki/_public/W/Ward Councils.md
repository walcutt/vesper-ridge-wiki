title: Ward Councils
---

Committees of public servants appointed by the [[Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council]], in charge of passing minor laws and administering the public services of individual city wards. Each ward has its own Ward Council.

Because the Parliamentary Council directly appoints Ward Council members, and most of the seats of the Parliamentary Council are in turn appointed by the [[High Noble Houses]], the Ward Council system is another way for the nobility to maintain its control over the rest of the city.
