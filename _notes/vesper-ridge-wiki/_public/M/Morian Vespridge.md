title: Morian Vespridge

A charismatic nobleman of middling peerage from the Holy Kingdom of Alinor, exiled from the kingdom 370 years ago for blasphemy against the crown after he spoke out against what he perceived to be the “draconian theocracy” of the reigning monarch. As Baron Vespridge left the kingdom, he promised his retainers and the peasants of his barony a share of his fortune if they followed him into the wilderness. It was evident to the people that he was in no position to be distributing wealth right after losing his land and title, but their own lives in the kingdom were in a precarious state with the crown’s ire fixated upon Baron Vespridge and “his seditious followlings,” so many chose to leave with him nonetheless. Together they set out on a trek eastward across the highlands and the barrens, settled by a bay of the Great Sea and founded the town that would eventually become known as Vesper Ridge.
