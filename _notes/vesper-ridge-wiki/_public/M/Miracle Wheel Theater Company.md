title: Miracle Wheel Theater Company
---

An acclaimed performing arts troupe from the [[Southern Ward]]. Each year, they premiere a new original play or opera first in [[Vesper Ridge]], and then in [[Holy Kingdom of Alinor|Alinor]] and [[Lirian Confederation|Lirios]]. And each year, without fail, they sell out venues in all three nations. Miracle Wheel claims that all of their scripts are written by a single one of their actors, but the specific question of which actor is kept a tight secret. Fans and columnists all have their own theories, and many an argument has been started over which performer must be the genius responsible for so many modern classics.

The companyâ€™s logo is a spinning wagon wheel.
