title: The Mediastinum
---

A grotesque circular chamber carved from smooth stone and smooth muscle, framing at its center an impossibly large heart, malformed and slowly beating. Here did our party find themselves after Ophileâ€™s death, and here did our party witness the birth of a [[Searchlights]]: hatching violently from the heart like a chick from an egg. After the Searchlight fell, so to did the Mediastinum vanish.

Its many veins flow with the memories we have lost.
