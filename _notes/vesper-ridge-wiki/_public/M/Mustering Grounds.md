title: Mustering Grounds
---

Just outside the Twin Gates along Vesper Ridge’s southern wall, the Mustering Grounds are the primary encampment for “exterior” units of the city constabulary. From this site, constables regularly patrol the few vital roads that cut through the inhospitable Barrens.

Duchess Axelia Vespridge is sometimes seen here, leading training exercises for the troops.
