The title held by petty mages employed as public servants in the [[Vesper Ridge Customs and Notary Bureau]]. These bureaucrats are responsible for magically scanning mail that enters the city, identifying magical contraband, and other menial tasks that require the use of arcane magic.

One of their number was recently murdered in cold blood by the [[Bloody Butterfly|Butterfly]].
