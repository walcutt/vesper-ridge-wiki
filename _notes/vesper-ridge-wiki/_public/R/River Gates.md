title: River Gates
---

The northwestern entrance to Vesper Ridge, just slightly south of the point where the Old River flows into the city. Most travelers who do not already have prior appointments or Permits of Stay are directed to enter through these gates, and it is no coincidence that the adjacent Sunset and Harbor Wards are the poorest in the city. It is said that the River Gates accept all who enter, but allow few to leave.
