title: Rook
---

A tall humanoid, 27 years of age, with piercing eyes and a body covered in white feathers. Despite his superficial resemblance to avian [[beastfolk]], his facial features and body proportions stand out as unusual in a way that is difficult to place.

Rook lives at [[Cairwick Chapel]], and involves himself heavily in the affairs of the surrounding [[Harbor Ward]]. He sleeps very little.
