title: Rogier Quillix
---

The head of House Quillix, the eighth of the High Noble Houses. Most members of the aristocracy, and especially the nobility, are seen as unapproachably far removed from regular Vesperite society, but Lord Quillix has a softer reputation as a kindly old man who loves to chat with just about anyone.

He spends little time occupied with the matters of his noble house, entrusting such work to his family and servants, and chooses instead to spend his days managing the Velvet Ward Public Library. For this, some see him as irresponsible.
