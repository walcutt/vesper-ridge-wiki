title: Ofelia Kerrifer
---

The leading lady of House Kerrifer, equal parts elegant and pompous. She plays host to frequent masquerade balls and garden parties in her stately manor, during which aspiring musicians often provide free entertainment in their bid to win Lady Kerriferâ€™s patronage. Those who succeed often go on to lead highly successful careers, but those who fail to impress her leave in disgrace, seldom able to show their faces in high society again.
