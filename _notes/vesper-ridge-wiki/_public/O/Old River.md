title: Old River
---

A broad, gently-flowing river that originates in the [[Lindenwood]], flows from the forest into the [[Barrens]], passes through the [[Harbor Ward]], and terminates in the [[Sea of Wine]]. The Old River is an important avenue of trade between [[Linden Glen]] and [[Vesper Ridge]], and much of the lumber used in Vesper Ridgeâ€™s buildings arrives upon the Old River.

Additionally, the river is a major source of drinking water for Vesper Ridge, but such water must be collected before it enters the Harbor Ward because the river becomes increasingly polluted as it makes its way through the city.
