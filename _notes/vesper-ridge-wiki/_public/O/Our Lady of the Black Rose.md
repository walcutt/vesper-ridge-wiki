title: Our Lady of the Black Rose
---

An ancient, gentle goddess. Her purview is mercy, healing, forgiveness, love, and community. Like most gods of [[the Hallowed Lands]], her true name is unknown, and so she is often referred to simply as “the Black Rose,” or as “Our Lady” by her faithful.

Her symbology is floral; naturally the rose is her holiest symbol, but she is also often represented with imagery of small but tenacious weeds growing through the cracks in dry earth and cobblestones. Black is a holy color to her faith, and silver is a holy substance.

Because her doctrine preaches forgiveness and second chances, her faith is seen as heretical by the rigid [[The Church of the Guiding Way|Church of the Guiding Way]]. Followers of the Black Rose are commonly derided as cheaters, sinners, people who must be guilty of awful things to need the goddess’s forgiveness. There is at least some truth to this narrative; convicts and the repentant are among her most devout followers.

Open worship of Our Lady of the Black Rose is illegal in [[Holy Kingdom of Alinor|Alinor]], but not in Vesper Ridge. Even so, her following is highly taboo and public sites of worship are exceedingly rare within the city.
