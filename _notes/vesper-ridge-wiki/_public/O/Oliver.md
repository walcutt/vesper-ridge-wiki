title: Oliver
---

A human boy, ten years of age, who lives at [[Cairwick Chapel]]. He is timid, quiet, and rather small for his age. Unlike most residents of the church, Oliver has a living relative within the city –[[Arthur|an older brother]]– but the two live apart for reasons Oliver has not shared... perhaps because Arthur would find it awkward to live together with [[Rook]], his ex-boyfriend? However, Oliver still cares deeply for his brother, and he’s grateful to our party for rescuing him from [[Black Light Mining Company|Black Light]]’s attack on [[The Dockyards]].
