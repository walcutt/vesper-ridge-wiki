title: Oliver
---

A human boy, ten years of age, who lives at [[Cairwick Chapel]]. He is timid, quiet, and rather small for his age. Unlike most residents of the church, Oliver has a living relative within the city –an [[Arthur|older brother]]– but the two live apart for reasons Oliver has not shared. - However, Oliver still cares deeply for his brother, and begged our party to save him from a fight that broke out in [[The Dockyards]].
