title: The Gloaming Lantern
---

A mysterious device Margot recovered from the burning [[Vesper Ridge Customs and Notary Bureau River Gates Branch Municipal Office|customs bureau]] at the start of our story. Deeply magical, it produces its own light without an apparent fuel source, and seems to react to the thoughts or emotions of its bearer, but these traits are trivial compared to its true power: the ability to rewrite time itself. For reasons unknown, and through means unknown, the lantern has formed a connection with the members of our party, and dragged the very sun backwards across the sky to undo Ophile's untimely death.

What happened afterwards was less clear.

Other information: [[Chambermaid Calliope]] recognized the lantern, and warned the party that some “dangerous individuals” may be interested in it... a warning that was contextualized when [[Calix Hypatia|Lord Calix Hypatia]] later asserted to Ophile that the lantern actually belongs to him. For now, at least, it remains safely in our party’s hands. According to the strange automaton M-41D, the Gloaming Lantern is somehow connected to [[The Clocktower]].
