title: The Gloaming Lantern
---

A mysterious device Margot recovered from the burning [[Vesper Ridge Customs and Notary Bureau River Gates Branch Municipal Office|customs bureau]] at the start of our story. Deeply magical, it produces its own light without an apparent fuel source, and seems to react to the thoughts or emotions of its bearer. Through careful study and meditation, Margot has gained a rudimentary attunement to the lantern, but its purpose, and much of its power, is as of yet unknown.

[[Chambermaid Calliope]] recognized the lantern, and warned the party that some “dangerous individuals” may be interested in it.
