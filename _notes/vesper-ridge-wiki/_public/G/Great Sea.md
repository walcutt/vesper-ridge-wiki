title: Great Sea
---

A seemingly endless expanse of water that surrounds the Hallowed Lands on all sides. The Sea of Wine is one of its many bays.

The Great Sea is largely unmapped, prone to fierce storms, and home to all manner of dangerous monsters. Naturally, some brave explorers have set out on expeditions away from the Hallowed Landsâ€™ shores, but none have made land on other continents and returned to tell the tale. As such, aside from many small islands, the locations of any foreign lands remain unknown.
