title: The Keeper
---

The reigning deity over [[the Hallowed Lands]]. His faith is widespread throughout both [[Holy Kingdom of Alinor|Alinor]] and [[Lirian Confederation|Lirios]], as well as in [[Vesper Ridge]] between them. Though some other gods still retain scattered followings, there exists no organized religion on the continent aside from His. The Keeper is a god of justice, consequences, and “the natural order of things.” His followers pray to Him to right what they see as the wrongs of the world, to restore order in times of unrest, to restore their health in times of sickness, and to bring punishment to those who wrong them.

The Keeper’s faith is known as [[the Church of the Guiding Way]], and Vesper Ridge’s central house of worship was, until recently, the [[Cathedral of Guiding Light]] in the [[Tower Ward]].
