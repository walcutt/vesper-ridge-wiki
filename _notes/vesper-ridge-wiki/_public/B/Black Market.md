title: Black Market
---

A weekly gathering of smugglers with products to move and traders unscrupulous enough to help them, usually in the southern [[Harbor Ward]] or northern [[Sunset Ward]]. Here, buyers can find all manner of items frowned upon by polite society. Despite the rogue's gallery of dangerous individuals who gather here (many of whom would spill each other's blood in broad daylight), all of the market's vendors strictly forbid violence upon the market grounds.

[[Rook]] and [[Emi]] both occasionally visit.
