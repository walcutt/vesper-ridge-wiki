title: Beastfolk
---

A sentient race native to the Hallowed Lands, similar to humans in stature and lifespan. Beastfolk are distinguished by the presence of animal features on their bodies, which can range from subtly inhuman ears to entirely beastlike faces and thick fur covering the entire body. In Vesper Ridge, beastfolk are the second most populous race, after humans.
