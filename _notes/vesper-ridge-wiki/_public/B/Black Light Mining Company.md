title: Black Light Mining Company
---

The second-largest [[Tallow Guilds|tallow guild]] in [[Vesper Ridge]], and the only one capable of rivaling the influence of [[the Delving Guild]]. The Black Light Mining Company, often referred to simply as “Black Light” by [[Vesperite|Vesperites]], holds many secrets. Its founder and current owner are both unknown, and lower-level employees often don’t even know the names of their own supervisors. Despite the guild’s secrecy, it is well-known that Black Light engages in a great deal of illegal activity, making frequent use of extortion and blackmail to gain a foothold in many of Vesper Ridge’s industries. In the [[Harbor Ward]], there are frequent clashes between Black Light mobsters and [[Dockworkers Union|Dockworkers’ Union]] vigilantes.

[[Rook]] seems to hold a particularly deep-seated hatred for them.

Some of Black Light’s employees appear to be rather monstrous... and it has become increasingly clear that the company has formed some sort of partnership with the feared [[Bloody Butterfly]]. How such a partnership came to be is unknown, and what will come of it remains to be seen.
