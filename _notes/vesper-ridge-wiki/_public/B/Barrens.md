title: Barrens
---

The undeveloped wilderness surrounding the city of [[Vesper Ridge]]. The acidic soil is inhospitable to agriculture and the rocky landscape is difficult to traverse by foot. In many places, hidden beneath boulders or tucked away in twisted alcoves, it is possible to find narrow cave entrances to the deep subterranean [[The Labyrinth|Labyrinth]]. Due to the difficulty of moving through the Barrens, the few major roads and underground rail tunnels carved through the region are seen as vital infrastructure, and are regularly patrolled by the [[constabulary]].
