title: Bloody Butterfly
---

The popular nickname for a mysterious serial killer currently at large in [[Vesper Ridge]]. Their identity and motive are both unknown, but the pattern of their killings seems to target mages as well as individuals in positions of authority. So far, the [[constabulary]] has been completely foiled in its attempts to catch this killer. The city’s newspapers, especially the popular [[Forum Square Gazette]], report on the Bloody Butterfly’s rampage in lurid detail.
