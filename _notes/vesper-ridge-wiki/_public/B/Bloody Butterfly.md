title: Bloody Butterfly
---

The popular nickname for a mysterious serial killer currently at large in [[Vesper Ridge]]. Their identity and motive are both unknown, but the pattern of their killings seems to target mages and authority figures. So far, the [[constabulary]] has been completely foiled in its attempts to catch this killer. The city’s newspapers, especially the popular [[Forum Square Gazette]], report on the Bloody Butterfly’s rampage in lurid detail.

The Butterfly’s recent crimes include the destruction of a [[Vesper Ridge Customs and Notary Bureau River Gates Branch Municipal Office|Customs Bureau office]] and the bizarrely ritualistic murder of [[Poor Jimmy Ashcroft]] on the steps of [[Cairwick Chapel]]. Eyewitness accounts describe this mysterious figure as “like a walking ghost” and apparently faceless or somehow invisible beneath their (or its?) black veil. This description was recently corroborated for the party by one [[Cortis|Mr. Cortis]], an undertaker whose place of business the Butterfly recently ransacked in the process of conducting some sort of dark ritual. Apparently, the Bloody Butterfly seeks to “[[Supplicants|create worshipers]]” for itself. Additionally, it has become increasingly clear that the Butterfly is engaged in a sort of tenuous partnership with the [[Black Light Mining Company]], though the nature of their alliance (and what both sides seek to gain from it) remains unclear.
