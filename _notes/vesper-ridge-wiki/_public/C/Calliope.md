title: Calliope
---

A maid, of sorts, in service of the esteemed [[House Vespridge]]. She claims to report directly to [[Axelia Vespridge|Duchess Axelia]].

Calliopeâ€™s clothing is fine and dignified, but her eyes are frightfully, inhumanly dark. Our party came across her locked in combat with a [[Searchlights|strange mechanical figure]], and helped her defeat it. After the battle, she introduced herself without making eye contact, shared a bit of knowledge about the nobility, and warned Margot to be careful with [[The Gloaming Lantern]].

When questioned on the matter, Calliope revealed herself to be a worshiper of the [[Our Lady of the Black Rose|Black Rose]]. Calliope harbors a distrust for [[House Hypatia]], but will not explain why; the nature of her work demands a certain level of secrecy.
