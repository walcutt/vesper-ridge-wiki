An undertaker, and sole proprietor of a small funeral home near the center of the [[Harbor Ward]]. He had a brush with death when the [[Bloody Butterfly]] broke into his home and drifted down to the morgue to perform some kind of [[Supplicants|sinister magic upon the corpses]] held therein. Luckily for Cortis, the Butterfly seemed to ignore his presence and left without raising a spectral hand against him.
