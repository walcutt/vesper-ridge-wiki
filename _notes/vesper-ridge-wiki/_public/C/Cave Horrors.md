title: Cave Horrors
---

The colloquial name for the countless monsters that inhabit [[the Labyrinth]], the network of caverns lying beneath [[Vesper Ridge]]. It is unknown how old they are, how they got beneath the city, and how many of them exist. Due to the sheer danger of their habitat, few attempts have been made to study them in an academic capacity, and consequently many aspects of their biology (such as how they reproduce and how they feed) are also mysteries. Cave horrors have never been seen venturing onto the surface, but despite their reclusiveness most cave horrors are dangerous and will attack if approached. Even so, the industries of Vesper Ridge rely on cave horror [[tallow]] to function, and so [[Hunter-Miner|hunter-miners]] of varying skill and preparedness frequently venture into the Labyrinth to hunt these creatures.

Cave horrors range in size from as small as vermin to as massive as ancient dragons, and come in all manner of shapes. Some even vaguely resemble humanoids.
