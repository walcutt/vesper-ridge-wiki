title: Cadence
---

A painter and singer, and a resident of [[Cairwick Chapel]]. Cadence is not particular about matters of gender, always steering the conversation back toward art whenever theyâ€™re asked. They like to sing while painting, usually outdoors in the garden behind the church. They get along particularly well with [[Leonora]], despite being opposites in almost every way.
