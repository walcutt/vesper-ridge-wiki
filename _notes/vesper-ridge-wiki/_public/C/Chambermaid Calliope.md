title: Chambermaid Calliope
---

A maid in service of the esteemed [[House Vespridge]]. Her clothing is fine and dignified, but her eyes are frightfully, inhumanly dark. Our party came across her locked in combat with a [[Searchlight|strange mechanical figure]], and helped her defeat it. After the battle, she introduced herself without making eye contact, shared a bit of knowledge about the nobility, and warned Margot to be careful with [[the Gloaming Lantern]].

When questioned on the matter, Calliope revealed herself to be a worshiper of the [[Our Lady of the Black Rose|Black Rose]].
