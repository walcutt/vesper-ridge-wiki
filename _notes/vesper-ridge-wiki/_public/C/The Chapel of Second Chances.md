title: The Chapel of Second Chances
---

A “church” managed by a young priestess named [[Sister Linia]] on the site of what was once known as [[Cairwick Orphanage]]. Linia, a priestess of the [[Our Lady of the Black Rose|Black Rose]], opens the building’s doors to the public each morning for services and breakfast. Despite the offer of free food, most [[Vesperite|Vesperites]] are hesitant to set foot in a church of the heretical goddess, and [[Rook]] keeps a close eye on any visitors who do appear. According to Linia, the Chapel of Second Chances is named after a similar church to the Black Rose that stood in [[Vesper Ridge]] hundreds of years ago.
