title: Crimson Gulls
---

Shorebirds with red-tipped white plumage, commonly found all along the shores of the [[Great Sea]]. They are notable for their immunity to [[rhodofolia]]’s hallucinogenic vapors and to its digestive acids. Due to this unique biological niche, crimson gulls are especially common near the [[Sea of Wine]] (where the algae is endemic), and feed upon both the rhodofolia and the scraps of any other creature that isn’t completely dissolved after falling into the water.
