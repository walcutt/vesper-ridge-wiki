title: Constabulary
---

An organization that serves as both the police and military of [[Vesper Ridge]]. It is divided into “interior” units that operate within the city and “exterior” units that patrol the [[Barrens]] and defend the city gates against more aggressive wildlife.

Most [[Vesperite|Vesperites]] believe the [[Black Light Mining Company]] must pay the Constabulary to turn a blind eye to their myriad illegal activities, though conflicts between the two organizations do still occur. [[Axelia Vespridge|Duchess Axelia Vespridge]] is the Constabulary’s highest commanding officer.

It appears that constable officers are currently carrying out an investigation in the west end of the city, in the wake of the [[Vesper Ridge Customs and Notary Bureau River Gates Branch Municipal Office|customs office’s]] destruction.
