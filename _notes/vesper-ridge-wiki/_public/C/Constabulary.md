title: Constabulary
---

An organization that serves as both the police and military of Vesper Ridge. It is divided into “interior” units that operate within the city and “exterior” units that patrol the roads and defend the city gates against more aggressive Barrens wildlife.

Most Vesperites believe the Black Light Mining Company must pay the Constabulary to turn a blind eye to their myriad illegal activities, though conflicts between the two organizations do still occur. Duchess Axelia Vespridge is the Constabulary’s highest commanding officer.
