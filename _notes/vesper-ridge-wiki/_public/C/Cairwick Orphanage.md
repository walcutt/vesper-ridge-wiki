title: Cairwick Orphanage
---

Built 50 years prior to the events of Dim Light, this house of refuge operated for two decades with funding from the [[Harbor Ward]] [[Ward Councils|Council]] before its budget dried up and it was forced to close its doors. The fates of its original caretakers and orphans are unknown, but rumors suggest the children ended up “encouraged” to do “volunteer work” at the [[Sea of Wine|waterfront]]. [[Dockworkers Union|The Dockworkers' Union]], which now keeps a protective watch over the newly-repaired building and its current informal staff, would never allow such a tragedy to repeat itself. Perhaps this could be seen as a small sign of positive progress in a city that becomes bleaker by the day.

Though the orphanage is still officially closed according to Harbor Ward Council records, it was given new purpose two years ago thanks to [[Rook]] and [[Sister Linia]]: it now serves as a [[The Chapel of Second Chances|church]] to the [[Our Lady of the Black Rose|Black Rose]] and well as home to a small community of people with nowhere else to go.
