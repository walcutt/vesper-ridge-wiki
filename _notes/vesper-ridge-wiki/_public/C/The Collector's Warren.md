Containing an ancient stone shrine of unknown purpose, this isolated grotto in [[the Labyrinth]] is where [[the Old Man Upstairs]] hid his prized set of holy books. Some time after his untimely death, a [[Cave Horrors|cave horror]] known as [[the Collector]] took up residence in the warren and claimed the books as its own, although it seemed more interested in other prizes...

The tunnels leading to the Warren seemed to take a different layout on the partyâ€™s way back to the surface.
