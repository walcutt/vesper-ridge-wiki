title: Claire
---

A young human woman who lives at [[Cairwick Chapel]], in her late teens or early 20s. Claire arrived at the chapel's doorstep seven months ago in a fancy dress caked in dried mud. She tends to follow [[Sister Linia]] around, and has attended every single morning sermon since the day she arrived. Claire is polite toward her neighbors and helps take care of the church, but people tend to see her as a bit strange. Her smile doesn't reach her eyes.
