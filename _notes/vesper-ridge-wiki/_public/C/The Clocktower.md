title: The Clocktower
---

The most famous and most enigmatic structure in the city of [[Vesper Ridge]]. Far taller than any of the [[Velvet Ward]]’s mansion spires or the [[Foundry Ward]]’s smokestacks, it looms over them all from the exact center of the [[Tower Ward]], the exact center of the entire city. Its architect is unknown, its date of construction is unknown, and its function is unknown. Ostensibly it was built to keep track of time, and intricate systems of cogs and gears are visible behind its clock faces, but the clock never ticks. There are no visible entrances to the building, and no blueprints from its construction have ever been found. In fact, no written documents that mention the Clocktower seem to exist, anywhere. Stranger still, anyone who attempts to describe the Clocktower in writing, or portray its image on a visual medium, soon finds their work lost, the document inevitably vanishing into thin air the moment it leaves their sight.
