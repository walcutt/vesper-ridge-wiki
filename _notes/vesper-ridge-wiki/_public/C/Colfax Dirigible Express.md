title: Colfax Dirigible Express
---

The first (and so far the only) airship manufacturer in the Hallowed Lands. Its vehicles are meticulously engineered to exacting safety standards, each one requiring many months of work and millions of gold in production costs. Nevertheless, the airship business has proven highly profitable, mostly in commissions from city governments and large companies. There are, additionally, some very wealthy private individuals who have begun to commission Colfax for their own bespoke airships.

Politically, the Colfax Dirigible Enterprise is closely aligned with the Vesper Ridge nobility, owned as it is by Cooper Colfax of the High Noble Houses.

Despite the company’s success, many people still doubt the safety and practicality of airships, and it is common to hear the Colfax Dirigible Enterprise derisively referred to as “Ol’ Coop’s balloon bin.”
