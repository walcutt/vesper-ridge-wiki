title: Calix Hypatia
---

The head of [[House Hypatia]], the sixth of the [[High Noble Houses]]. Calix Hypatia is an outlier among the lords and ladies of the [[nobility]]: he is an [[Elves|elf]]. Some elves in [[Vesper Ridge]] have managed to secure comfortable livings for themselves and their families in the time since they first [[The Exodus|emigrated]] across the [[Great Sea]], but to attain nobility, especially the position of Lord of a noble house, is another matter entirely.

Calix’s life before his adoption into House Hypatia is not public knowledge, and neither is the identity of his blood family. Some members of the [[aristocracy]] are keen on learning more about his past, seeking ammunition to discredit him and cast him out of [[Ainsley Vespridge|Duke Vespridge]]’s good graces, but their efforts are so far unsuccessful.

During Chapter I of our story, our party traveled to his residence to answer Ophile’s invitation. Only Ophile was invited to meet Calix personally, but the mysterious nobleman shared many things with our young elf. Perhaps most notably, he claimed to have apprenticed in his youth as a scribe under Ophile’s mother, and claimed to be the rightful owner of [[the Gloaming Lantern]]. With the exception of Ophile, Calix seems to harbor a disdain for the party, but still promised to help you all avoid trouble in the upcoming arson trial.

He seems quite excited at the prospect of writing more letters to Ophile, though his rather forward personality may prove a bit troublesome.
