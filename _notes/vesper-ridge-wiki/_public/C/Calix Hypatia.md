title: Calix Hypatia
---

The head of House Hypatia, the sixth of the High Noble Houses. Calix Hypatia is an outlier among the lords and ladies of the nobility: he is an elf. Some elves in Vesper Ridge have managed to secure comfortable livings for themselves and their families in the time since they first emigrated across the Great Sea, but to attain nobility, especially the position of Lord of a noble house, is another matter entirely.

Calix’s life before his adoption into House Hypatia is not public knowledge, and neither is the identity of his blood family. Some members of the aristocracy are keen on learning more about his past, seeking ammunition to discredit him and cast him out of Duke Vespridge’s good graces, but their efforts are so far unsuccessful.
