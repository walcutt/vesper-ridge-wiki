title: Cooper Colfax
---

Technically the Lord of the third High Noble House, but chooses not to address himself as such. He keeps no servants, instead opting to pay professional secretaries to help run his company. Mr. Colfax lives in an (admittedly, quite posh) townhouse in the Tower Ward rather than a stately manor, though an ancestral Colfax Manor does still exist, and is managed by his hired workers. Despite his apparent humbleness compared to the other Lords and Ladies of the High Noble Houses, Mr. Colfax still takes full advantage of his political authority and never hesitates to use it to further the interests of the Colfax Dirigible Enterprise.
