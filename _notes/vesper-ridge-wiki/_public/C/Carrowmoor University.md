title: Carrowmoor University
---

The largest and most esteemed institution of higher education in [[Vesper Ridge]]. Carrowmoor was built in the northern [[Tower Ward]], though that area of the city has since been redistricted into what is now the [[Seventh Ward]].

The university was established by decree of the [[Vesper Ridge Parliamentary Council|VRPC]] in an effort to raise the prestige of Vesper Ridge in the eyes of the [[Holy Kingdom of Alinor|neighboring kingdoms]], and by all accounts the plan was a successâ€”Carrowmoor is widely regarded as one of the finest houses of learning in all [[the Hallowed Lands]]. Students of Carrowmoor are offered a varied curriculum, but the university specializes in science, medicine and engineering. Such fields are generally viewed as the most respectable (in no small part because they are the most profitable) by [[Aristocracy|upper-class]] [[Vesperite]] society.
